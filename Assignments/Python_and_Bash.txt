Take a score as input and print the grade based on the following:
90+ : "A"
80-89 : "B"
70-79 : "C"
60-69 : "D"
Below 60 : "F"
here we used a basic if else statement to carry out marks and all.

grade=int(input("Enter grade: "))
if grade < 60 :
    print("F")
elif grade >= 90 :
    print("A")
elif grade >= 80 and grade <= 89 :
    print("B")
elif grade >= 70 and grade <= 79 :
    print("C")
elif grade >= 60 and grade <= 69 :
    print("D")

2 Student Grades
Create a dictionary where the keys are student names and the values are their grades. Allow the user to:
Add a new student and grade.
Update an existing student’s grade.
Print all student grades.
Used dictionary and basic operations. Using if else:

student_grades ={}

while True:
    print("1 Add Student and Grades : ")
    print("2 Update an existing student’s grade : ")
    print("3 Print all student grades")
    print("4 Exit")
    choice = input("Enter your choice: ")
    if choice == "1" :
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        if name in student_grades:
            print("Student " + name + " is already registered")
        else:
            grade = int(input("Enter student grade: "))
            student_grades[name] = grade

    elif choice == "2" :
        name = input("Enter student name: ")
        if name in student_grades:
            grade = int(input("Enter student grade: "))
            student_grades[name] = grade
        else:
            print("Student not found.")
    elif choice == "3" :
        if not student_grades:
            print("Student not found.")
        else:
            for name, grade in student_grades.items():
                print(name, grade)



3.Write to a File
Write a program to create a text file and write some content to it.
Using file functions like write and open.

file_name =input("Enter the file name: ")
content = input("Enter the content: ")

with open(file_name,"w") as file:
    file.write(content)
print("File has been saved")


4. Read from a File
We used open in read mode and file.read to read and print to display.

with open(file_name,"r") as file:
    check=file.readline()
print(check)
