1. Creating and Renaming Files/Directories
Create a directory named test_dir using mkdir.
Inside test_dir, create an empty file called example.txt.
Rename example.txt to renamed_example.txt using mv
—->
	Mkdir test_dir
	Cd test_dir
	Touch example.txt
	Mv  example.txt  renamed_example.txt

2. Viewing File Contents
Use cat to display the contents of /etc/passwd.
Display only the first 5 lines of /etc/passwd using head.
Display only the last 5 lines of /etc/passwd using tail.
→
	Cat  /etc/passwd
	Head -n 5 /etc/passwd
	Tail -n 5 /etc/passwd

3.Searching for Patterns
Use grep to find all lines containing the word "root" in /etc/passwd
→
	Grep “root” /etc/passwd

4. Zipping and Unzipping
Compress the test_dir directory into a file named test_dir.zip using zip.
Unzip test_dir.zip into a new directory named unzipped_dir.
—> 
	Zip  test_dir  test_dir
	Unzip  test_dir.zip -d unzipped_dir

5. Downloading Files
Use wget to download a file from a URL (e.g., https://example.com/sample.txt).
—>
	Wget “ https://example.com/sample.txt”

6. Changing Permissions
Create a file named secure.txt and change its permissions to read-only for everyone using chmod.
→
	Touch secure.txt 
	Chmod 444 secure.txt 

7. Working with Environment Variables
Use export to set a new environment variable called MY_VAR with the value "Hello, Linux!".
→
Export MY_VAR= "Hello, Linux!"
Echo $MY_VAR
